This is a book management system implemented by Java, Swing, JDBC, Maven, and MySQL.

In order to use the jar:
1. You need to have MySQL downloaded on your computer (make sure your MySQL username is root, and password is zhao676730056, if not, follow "Use source code instead").
2. Execute the SQL script in your MySQL.
3. Run the jar. On the login page, log in as a user: 12345, 12345, or log in as an admin: admin, admin.


Use source code instead:
1. Enter my-bobst-system\src\main\java\utils\JDBCUtil.java, and change the username and password to your MySQL's. 
2. Execute the SQL script in your MySQL.
3. Then redo compile and package to get the new jar, or directly run the program.
4. On the login page, log in as a user: 12345, 12345, or log in as an admin: admin, admin.
